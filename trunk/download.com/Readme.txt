Thank you for enabling your product with Upload.com Merchant Services configuration.

What's in this zip file?

- YourProductName.dat: This is your original application, encrypted and renamed as a .dat file. For example, if your file was called YourProductName.exe, it is now encrypted and renamed YourProductName.dat.

- YourProductName.exe: This is the license monitor and application launcher that replaces your application. It uses the same name and icons as your original application.

- This readme.txt file.

What do I do now?

1. Rebuild your installer, including both the .dat and .exe files in the same directory (your application now consists of at least the two files YourProductName.exe and YourProductName.dat).

2. Copy the new installation package, now enabled with your Merchant Service configuration, to the place where Upload.com will look for it.
 
3. Visit your Upload Manager to verify that your Download Link points to the correct URL for the rebuilt product.

What do these files do?

The license monitor verifies the license and then launches your application. Throughout the trial period, the license monitor offers end users the option to purchase a permanent license. The license monitor will continue to unlock or restrict product access according to the trial or permanent license terms.
